Review Status: Not Reviewed
## Introduction
This document covers Stereoscopic Vision specified in [Cal Poly Pomona's Self Driving Husky A200](https://github.com/cpp-self-driving-husky/cpp-husky-a200-design-doc). Stereoscopic Vision is one way for an autonomous vehicle to determine how far away an object is. On the Husky A200, a stereoscopic camera will be used along with LIDAR and sonar in order to aid in obstacle avoidance.
## User Stories

## Requirements
* The vehicle shall detect stationary obstacles to avoid.
* The vehicle shall use multiple sensor types that are unrelated in data acquisition method to detecct obstacles.
